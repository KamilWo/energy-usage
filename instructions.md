`readings.json`

You can add files to your submission, but if you edit any of the provided files, other than those specified, your changes will be IGNORED.

Please read these instructions carefully before starting to code:
When you assemble your code challenge solution for submission please create it as a ZIP file.
Please do NOT include generated files in your submitted solution.
Your ZIP upload will be cleaned to remove ignored (e.g. generated) files.
Files will be removed and ignored based on standard gitignore files as specified in this GitHub project: github/gitignore.
When you upload your code, you will be shown which files are accepted for code review and which will be ignored.

`The ignored files will NOT be provided to the reviewer.`

Create your solution WITHIN the structure of the starting ZIP file that you have downloaded.
When you are ready to upload your code, you can re-ZIP from the starting top-level directory and upload the entire ZIP by clicking the UPLOAD SOLUTION button below.
