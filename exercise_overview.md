# Overview

Thank you for interviewing at Bulb and taking the time to complete this coding exercise.

We expect the challenge to take around 3-4 hours, however feel free to take as long as you need.
If you run out of time, that’s fine, just send us a README with the details of what you planned 
to include in your implementation.

Please approach this as you would a production problem with respect to quality and consider that 
we will ask you to extend your work in a pairing exercise as part of the technical interview.

The instructions are duplicated in the `README.md` file in the starting code ZIP file that should download.

In this challenge, we’d like you to write a small program which, given a set of meter readings, 
computes a member’s monthly energy bill. To do this, we have stubbed out the following files for you:

bill_member.py, which contains functions to compute the customer bill and print it to screen.
You should implement `calculate_bill`. This is the entry point to your solution.
`calculate_bill` is currently hardcoded to give the correct answer for August 2017.
There’s no need to change calculate_and_print_bill.
test_bill_member.py, a test module for bill_member.
main.py, the entry point for the program, there’s no need to make changes to this module.
tariff.py, prices by kWh for all energy
load_readings.py, provides a function for loading the readings from the given json.
readings.json, contains a set of monthly meter readings for a given year, member and fuel

We’d like you to:

Implement the `calculate_bill` function, so that given a `member_id`, optional `account` 
argument and `billing date`, we can compute the bill for the customer.

We do not want you to spend time on:

Making this backwards compatible with python <= 3.

You can assume:

- All times are UTC.
- We’re only dealing with £ denominated billing.
- You only need to handle electricity and gas billing.
- Energy is consumed linearly.
- The billing date is the last day of the month.
- Readings are always taken at midnight.
- There is only one meter reading per billing period.
- The JSON file structure will remain the same in any follow on exercise.
